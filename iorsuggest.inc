 *
 * A function that suggests an adjustment to a material's index of refraction
 * that yields reasonably accurate dispersion for most materials.
 *
 * Background: IORs are normally given at wavelength D, but POV-Ray's dispersion
 * algorithm assumes that the given IOR is for a wavelength midway between red
 * and violet.  For a discussion, see:
